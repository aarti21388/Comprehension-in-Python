# What are comprehentions in python? Why do we use them?
## Diffrence between list , dict ,set & generator comprehentions

-> Comprehentions in python provide us with a short and  concise way to construct new sequences(such as lists,set,dictionary etc.) using sequences which have been already defined.
-> We can create new sequences using a given python sequence.
-> This is called comprehention.

## Python supports the following 4 types of comprehentions:

* List comprehentions
* Dictionary comprehentions
* Set comprehentions
* Generator comprehentions

## List Comprehention [It will generate new list]
